**Stop paying $20,000/year for compliance tools. Get audit-ready for free.**

AuditKit scans your AWS/Azure/GCP infrastructure and tells you exactly what's blocking your SOC2, ISO 27001, or PCI DSS certification. No consultants, no black boxes, just code.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes to Your First Scan)

```bash
# Install
curl -L https://github.com/guardian-nexus/auditkit/releases/latest/download/auditkit-linux-amd64 -o auditkit
chmod +x auditkit

./auditkit scan --provider aws --profile production

# Generate audit report
./auditkit report --format pdf > soc2-audit-report.pdf
```
