# Changelog

All notable changes to AuditKit will be documented in this file.

## [v0.6.6] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- PCI-DSS nil pointer crash when AWS API calls fail
- Duplicate `min` function compilation error
- Stripped debug paths from release binaries

### Added
- Sample reports and examples in `docs/examples/`
- Real-world use case documentation

### Changed

## [v0.6.5] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed PCI-DSS scanner crash when AWS credentials lack EC2:DescribeSecurityGroups permission
- Improved error handling in network segmentation checks (Req 1.2.1, 2.2.2)
- Removed hardcoded development paths from source files

## [v0.6.4] - 2025-10-10

### Enhanced Compliance Reporting

**Report Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive compliance disclaimers to PDF and HTML reports
- Enhanced clarity on automated vs manual control requirements
- Improved CMMC Level 1 reporting with FCI-specific guidance
- Fixed HTML percentage display formatting in score circles
- Added framework-specific assessor requirements (C3PAO, QSA, etc.)

**Technical Updates:**
- Updated Azure scanner parameter ordering for CMMC Level 1 checks
- Improved report structure to distinguish automated checks from manual documentation
- Enhanced evidence collection guidance in all report formats

**User Experience:**
- Reports now clearly show:
  - Automated technical checks (infrastructure/configurations)
  - Manual documentation requirements (policies/procedures)
  - Formal assessment requirements by qualified auditors
- Better guidance on what constitutes full compliance vs automated check scores

### Why This Matters

High automated check scores do not equal full compliance. This update helps users:
- Understand the scope of automated scanning
- Identify manual documentation gaps
- Prepare properly for formal assessments
- Avoid misinterpreting technical scores as compliance certifications

## [v0.6.3] - 2025-10-09

- Spacing in passed controls section ([PASS] now has proper spacing)

### Added
- Professional PDF cover page with circular compliance score
- Executive summary section in plain English
- Full HTML report generator with modern, responsive design
- Interactive tabs in HTML reports (Failed/Passed controls)
- Clickable Console URLs in HTML reports
- Copy-paste ready remediation commands in code blocks

### Changed
- Improved evidence collection guide formatting
- Enhanced visual hierarchy in both PDF and HTML outputs

### Technical
- Created new `/pkg/report/html.go` with 644 lines of clean HTML generation
- Refactored PDF generation functions to avoid naming conflicts
- Updated `main.go` HTML output to use new generator

## [v0.6.2] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Fixed CMMC showing 0/17 controls (now properly returns results)
- Fixed SOC2 showing 0/0 controls (framework filtering bug)
- Fixed PCI showing 0/0 controls (framework filtering bug)
- Fixed import path issues

**This is a hotfix for v0.6.1**

## [v0.6.1] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **M365 Integration**: New `integrate` command for importing ScubaGear M365 security results
- **Community Contribution**: Comprehensive Entra ID mappings (29 rules) contributed by community member
- Unified compliance reporting across AWS, Azure, and M365
- Step-by-step remediation guidance for M365 controls
- Screenshot evidence collection instructions for Entra ID policies
- Direct Azure portal console URLs for each control
- Framework mappings: M365 findings now map to SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA

### Changed
- Updated version to v0.6.1
- Improved error messages for integration failures
- Enhanced verbose mode for debugging integration parsing

### Removed
- Telemetry tracking completely removed (no analytics or usage tracking)

### Technical
- New integration framework at `pkg/integrations/`
- ScubaGear parser implementation
- Community-contributed mappings at `mappings/scubagear/entra.json`

### Credits
Special thanks to our community contributor for the comprehensive Entra ID security mappings that make AuditKit the first open-source tool providing unified AWS, Azure, and M365 compliance reporting.
